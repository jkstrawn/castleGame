You have been tasked by your liege to guard his fields of corn from poachers and theives. One night, on patrok, you stumble across a haggard man in thread-bare clothing stealing corn from the field. You quickly confront him, and he immediately begs for his life. He claims he is stealing corn to feed his family since the lord of the land - your liege - demands too much in taxes. Your liege is indeed known from his harsh taxes throughout the land. Make your choice.
	I slay the man on the spot as my liege would expect me to do, as he nothing more than a thief and a liar.
	I turn over the man to my liege for punishment, as he has broken the law of the land and it is my sworn duty to enforce it. 
	I confiscate the corn he has stolen, warn him that stealing is a path toward doom and destruction, but I let him go to return to his family. 
	I allow the man to take enough corn to feed his family for a couple of days, encouraging him to leave the land. 

You are the sworn executioner for your liege. A man has been sent to you for execution as a traitor of the liege and your people. You know this individual as a close, virtuous friend who mysteriously vanished one day. You also know that the man's crimes for which he was convicted supposedly caused the deaths of many innocent civilians. Upon seeing you he begs for his life, claiming he was framed by a higher authority. Make your choice.
	I execute him as per my liege's instructions, and do it in such a manner that he suffers painfully before he dies as retribution for his crimes against my people.
	I execute him as per my liege's instructions, but doing so in as painless of a way as possible. Justice must be served, but I can show some compassion.
	I risk my own life and free him so that he may prove his innocence. If I can, I'll help him in any way.
